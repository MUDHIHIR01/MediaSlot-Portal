Hello Mudhihir,

 

Please use the business case below.

 

Overview

 

Front End Developer is tasked with building a web application where users can look up available digital ad slots, check ad sizes, rates, and availability. The platform should allow users to select the number of ads they want to book, see the total cost dynamically, and generate an invoice for checkout.

Core Features

1. User Interface & Navigation

The platform should be simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate.
Users should be able to search and filter available ad slots based on position, size, and price.
Avoid directly copying the reference example—creativity is encouraged.
2. Ad Booking System

Users should be able to select the number of ads they want to book.
The system must calculate the total cost in real time.
3. Checkout & Invoice Generation

Once ads are selected, users should be able to proceed to a checkout screen.
An invoice should be generated with details of booked ads, total cost, and payment options.
4. Technical Documentation

Provide a breakdown of the technology stack (frontend, backend, database, hosting).
Define API integrations (if needed for payments or other functionalities).
Security measures for handling user data.
Considerations for scalability and future enhancements.
